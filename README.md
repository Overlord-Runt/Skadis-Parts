# Attatchments for the Ikea Skadis Pegboard
Here you can find attachments I made to interface with the ikea Skadis, A pegboard that is used often for 3d printed parts and cool stuff.\
I made these parts for the #printbopard ysws and designed them around my own use cases.\
they all work around a removeable clip that makes them easier to print and store, making them way better for general use and makes them more modular.\
the parts you can find here are a modular storage box, a modular hook, a peg, a pen holder
